## About this slide show

If you're viewing this on "gitolite.com", please be aware that's only an
artifact of some very lazy DNS and hosting decisions, I made.  Just think of it
as "sitaramc.github.com" instead, because these pages really have nothing to
do with gitolite per se.  They're about git, in general.

### This document {-}

This document is vaguely inspired by
http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists, except this page is
not *just* for CS folks.  And it's a lot more detailed. Oh, and it's actively
maintained, meaning I will respond to feedback ;-)

### This slide show {-}

This slide show was all done with pandoc's slidy output mode, and a few little
pre-processing tweaks.  [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is
absolutely fantastic and bloody powerful!  I wish, I'd discovered it sooner but
now (Dec 2013) that I have, it's eliminating a lot of my home-grown scripts to
do various things like this!

The bulk of my tweaks are in terms of embedding
[graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) diagrams inside the main document, so there's
only one file to maintain!

# Basics

## What is a SHA?

A commit is uniquely identified by a 160-bit hex value (the 'SHA').  This is
computed from the following pieces of information:

  * the SHA of the "tree" of files and directories as they exist in that
    commit (details on how that SHA is computed is not relevant here)
  * the SHA of the parent commit(s) -- every commit except the very first one
    in the repo has at least one parent commit that the change is based upon.
  * the commit message -- what you type in the editor when you commit
  * the author name/email/timestamp
  * the committer name/email/timestamp

In the end, as I said, it's just a large, apparently random looking, number,
which is actually a cryptographically-strong checksum.  It's usually written
out as 40 hex digits.

Humans are not expected to remember this number.  For the purposes of this
discussion, think of it as something similar to a memory address returned by
malloc().

It is also GLOBALLY unique!  No commit in any repo anywhere in the world will
have the same SHA.  (It's not a mathematical impossibility, but just so
extremely improbable that we take it as fact.  If you didn't understand that,
just take it on faith).

An example SHA: `a30236028b7ddd65f01321af42f904479eaff549`

## What is a "ref"?

A ref is just a name for a SHA.  Branches or tags (described later) are refs.

There are also some special refs (the most common being `HEAD`), that are
usually **symbolic** refs (i.e., they usually point to a ref instead of
directly pointing to a SHA).

Anyway, for now just think of them as a human-readable name you gave to a SHA.

## What is a repo?

.#d

A repository ('repo') is a graph of commits.  In our figures, we represent
SHAs with numbers for convenience.  We also represent time going
upward (bottom to top).

.#d

    .gv fig01.png
    1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4
    .end

![a simple chain of commits](fig01.png)

.#t

## **Hey, why are the arrows backward in your pictures?** {-}

So why are the arrows pointing backward?

Well... every commit knows what its parent commit is (as described in the
"What is a SHA?" section, above).  But it can't know what it's child
commits are -- they haven't been made yet!

Therefore a repo is like a single linked list.  It cannot be a double linked
list -- this is because any change to the contents would change the SHA!

# Branch(es) and tag(s)

## Branch

.#d

Traditionally, the top of a linked list has a name.  That name is a **branch**
name.  We show branch names in green circles.

.#d

    .gv fig02.png
    1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4
    [g] master
    4 -- master
    .end

![a branch](fig02.png)

.#t

## More than one branch

(a.k.a "more than one child commit")

.#d

Remember, we said a repo is a **graph**.  Specifically, more than one child node
may be pointing at the same parent node.  In this case, each 'leaf node' is a
branch, and will have a name.

.#d

    .gv fig03.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    7 -- master
    .end

![three branches](fig03.png)

.#t

## More than one parent commit

.#d

Well, we can't keep creating more branches without eventually merging them
back.  So let's say "feature X" is now tested enough to be merged into the
main branch, so you `git merge feature_X`.  Here's what you get:

Notice that commit 8 now has 2 parents, showing that it is a "merge commit".

.#d

    .gv fig04.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    4 .. 8
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master
    .eq 4 6 7
    .end

![a merge commit](fig04.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

At this point, it's quite common to delete the feature branch, especially if
you anticipate no more "large" changes.  So you can run `git branch -d
feature_X`, which gives you this:

.#d

    .gv fig05.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    4 .. 8
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    feature_X [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    4 -- feature_X [ color = "gray" ]
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master
    .eq 4 6 7
    .end

![a deleted feature branch](fig05.png)

.#t

## Current and checked-out branch

.#d

There is a notion of a 'currently checked out' branch.  This is denoted by a
special ref called HEAD.  HEAD is a **symbolic** ref, which points to the
'current branch'.

.#d

    .gv fig06.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    7 -- master .. HEAD
    .end

![HEAD](fig06.png)

.#t

## Committing

.#d

When you make a new commit, the current branch moves.  Technically, whatever
branch HEAD is pointing to will move.

.#d

    .gv fig07.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master .. HEAD
    .eq 4 6 7

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    7 -- m_old .. h_old
    .end

![committing](fig07.png)

.#t

## Naming non-leaf nodes

.#d

It's not just 'leaf' nodes, but inner nodes can also have names.  Recall the
result of merging `feature_X` earlier (see the "more than one parent commit"
section):

.#d

    .gv fig08.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    4 .. 8
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master
    .eq 4 6 7
    .end

![non-leaf](fig08.png)

.#t

## {-}

At this point, you could leave `feature_X` as it is forever.  Or you could
delete the branch (as we showed in that section), in which case that label
would simply disappear.  (The commit it points to ("4") is safely reachable
from `master` because of the merge.  That is, it is not "lost", since there is
a sequence of commits from master which lead to it.)

.#d

You can also continue to develop on the `feature_X` branch, further refining
it with a view to once again merging it at some later point in time.  <font
color="gray">Although it's not relevant to the topic of this document, I should
mention that the usual practice is to first merge master back into `feature_X`
to make sure it has all the other stuff that master may have acquired till
now (this is shown by commit 9 below) before continuing further
development:</font>

.#d

    .gv fig09.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    4 .. 8
    2 .. 5
    .he 4 .. 9 .. 10
    .he 5 .. 6
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    10 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master
    .eq 4 6 7
    8 .. 9

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    feature_X_old [ label = "feature_X" ]
    4 -- feature_X_old
    .end

![further feature development](fig09.png)

.#t

## Tag

.#d

More commonly, inner nodes are **tags**.  We show tag names in yellow circles.

.#d

    .gv fig10.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    8 -- master .. HEAD
    .eq 4 6 7
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    .eq 3 "v1.0"
    .end

![a tag](fig10.png)

.#t

## The Difference between a branch and tag

.#d

The main difference between a branch and tag is branches move, tags don't.
When you make a commit with the "master" branch currently checked out, master
will move to point to the new commit.

.#d

    .gv fig11.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    [g] feature_X
    4 -- feature_X
    6 -- devel
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    .eq 4 6 7
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    .eq 3 "v1.0"

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    8 -- m_old .. h_old
    .end

# Digressions - 1

## What is a git URL?

Git repos are accessed by providing a URL.  There are typically 4 kinds of Git
URLs:

  * ssh: like `ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/`
  * http: like `http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/`
  * git: like `git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/` -- note that this is an
    unauthenticated protocol suitable only for allowing downloads of open
    source or similar software
  * local file: like `file:///full/path/to/reponame`

(see 'man git-clone' for all the allowed syntaxes for git URLs).

## What is a "remote"?

A remote is a short name (like an alias) used to refer to a specific git
repository.  Instead of always saying `git fetch git://sitaramc/gitolite`, you
can add that as a remote and use that short name instead of the long URL.

For convenience, a 'remote' called 'origin' is automatically created
when you clone a repo, pointing to the repo you cloned from.

# Local and Remote Repos

## Remote branch

.#d

Git is a distributed version control system.  So when you clone someone's
repo, you get all the branches in that one.  Remote branches are prefixed by
the name of the remote, and we show them in orange.

.#d

    .gv fig12.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "origin/devel"
    [o] "origin/feature_X"
    4 -- "origin/feature_X"
    6 -- "origin/devel"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    .eq 3 "v1.0"
    .end

![a remote](fig12.png)

.#t

## Multiple remotes

You can have several remotes.

    .gv fig13.png
    .he 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9
    3 .. 4
    2 .. 5
    .he 5 .. 6
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "origin/devel"
    [o] "origin/feature_X"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/devel"
    4 -- "origin/feature_X"
    6 -- "origin/devel"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    6 -- "sitas-repo/devel"
    9 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    .eq 3 "v1.0"
    .end

![several remotes](fig13.png "several remotes")

## Fetching and merging from another repo

.#d

Now let's say Sita's repo had a couple of new commits on its master, and you
run `git fetch sitas-repo`.  (We have pruned the graph a little for clarity,
showing only the relevant commits; the rest of the commits and branches are
assumed to be present as in the previous picture).

.#d

    .gv fig14.png
    ". . ." .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    srm_old [ label = "sitas-repo/master" ]
    9 -- srm_old
    .end

![before merge](fig14.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

Now you want to merge Sita's master branch into yours.  Since your master does
not have any commits that Sita's master doesn't have (i.e., Sita's master is
like a superset of yours), running `git merge sitas-repo/master` will get you
this:

.#d

    .gv fig15.png
    .he "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    11 -- master .. HEAD

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    9 -- m_old .. h_old
    .end

![after merge](fig15.png)

# Digressions - 2

## The object store

Git keeps all its data inside a special directory called `.git` at the top
level of your repository.  Somewhere in there is what we will simply call the
*object store* (if you're not comfortable with that phrase, pretend it's some
sort of database).

Git stores all your data in this object store.  There are 4 types of objects
in this store:

  * **blob** -- each file that you add to the repo is turned into a blob
    object.

  * **tree** -- each directory is turned into a tree object.

    Obviously, a tree object can contain other tree objects and blob objects,
    just like a directory can contain other directories and files.

  * **commit** -- a commit is a snapshot of your working tree at a point in
    time, although it contains a lot of other information also.

  * **tag** -- an annotated tag (please see `man git-tag`, for more info)
    contains the SHA of the commit being tagged, some other metadata, and the
    message.  A GPG-signed tag will also contain the GPG signature.

(Details, if you like: a blob is the lowest in the hierarchy.  One or more
blobs and trees make a tree.  A commit is a tree, plus the SHA of its parent
commit(s), the commit message, author/committer names and emails, and
timestamps.  Under normal usage, you don't need to deal with all this).

## What is a repo (again)?

Earlier, we saw that a repo was a graph of commits.  At the file system level,
however, it is basically a directory called `.git` which looks somewhat like
this

    $ ls -al .git
    total 40
    drwxrwxr-x 7 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 ./
    drwx------ 3 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 ../
    drwxrwxr-x 2 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 branches/
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 sitaram sitaram   92 Sep 14 18:54 config
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 sitaram sitaram   73 Sep 14 18:54 description
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 sitaram sitaram   23 Sep 14 18:54 HEAD
    drwxrwxr-x 2 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 hooks/
    drwxrwxr-x 2 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 info/
    drwxrwxr-x 4 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 objects/
    drwxrwxr-x 4 sitaram sitaram 4096 Sep 14 18:54 refs/

## Objects and branches/tags

.#d

The really, **really** important thing to understand is that the object store
doesn't care where the commit came from or what "branch" it was part of when
it entered the object store.  Once it's there, it's there!

Think back to these three diagrams.  The first is before you did a fetch.

.#d

    .gv fig16.png
    "[ . . . ]" .. 9
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    9 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    .end

![before fetch](fig16.png)

.#t

## {-}

The next two figures are after `git fetch sitas-repo` and `git merge
sitas-repo/master`, respectively.  The fetch command added two new commits (10
and 11) to your object store, along with any other objects those commits
reference.

.#d

    .gv fig17.png
    .he "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    srm_old [ label = "sitas-repo/master" ]
    9 -- srm_old
    .end

![after fetch](fig17.png)

.#d

    .gv fig18.png
    .he "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    11 -- master .. HEAD
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    9 -- m_old .. h_old
    .end

![after merge](fig18.png)

.#t

However, note that commits 10 and 11 did not change in any way simply because
they are now in **your local "master" branch**.  They continue to have the
same SHA values and the object store does not change as a result of this
command at all.

All you did was move a pointer from one node to another.

# Advanced Operations

## Merging

.#d

First, let's do merging.  The merge you saw earlier was what is called a
"fast-forward" merge, because your local master did not have any commits that
the remote branch you were merging did not have. In simple words,
"fast-forward" only happens when the branch you're merging is a superset of
branch you're merging to.

In practice, this is rare, especially on an active project with many
developers.  So let's see what that looks like.  The starting point was this:

.#d

    .gv fig19.png
    "[ . . . ]" .. 9
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    9 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- master .. HEAD
    .end

![before non-ff merge](fig19.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

Now, you made some changes on your local master.  Meanwhile, sitas-repo has
had some changes which you got by doing a fetch:

.#d

    .gv fig20.png
    .he "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 12 .. 13
    9 .. 10
    .he 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    13 -- master .. HEAD

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    9 -- m_old .. h_old
    srm_old [ label = "sitas-repo/master" ]
    9 -- srm_old
    .eq 9 srm_old
    .end

![after fetch](fig20.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

When you merge, the end result will usually look like this:

## Cherry-pick

A cherry-pick is not very commonly done -- in a well designed workflow it
should actually be rare.  However, it's a good way to illustrate an important
concept in git.

We said before that a commit represents a certain set of files and
directories, but since most commits have only one parent, you can think of a
commit as representing a set of changes too.  (In fact, most older VCSs do
this).

.#d

Let's say one of your collaborators (this mythical "Sita" again!) made a whole
bunch of changes to his copy of the repo.  You don't like most of these
changes, except one specific change which you would like to bring in to your
repo.

The starting point is this:

.#d

    .gv fig22.png
    "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 12
    .he 12 .. 13 .. 14
    .he 9 .. 10 .. 11
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    14 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    11 -- master .. HEAD
    .end

![before cherry-pick](fig22.png)

Here, sitas-repo has 3 commits on his master (12, 13, and 14) and you are only
interested in the change that commit 13 made.

.#t

## {-}

.#d

Don't worry about the meaning of the `~1` for now (although you ought to be
able to guess!), but here's the command you might run:

    git cherry-pick sitas-repo/master~1

This results in the following commit graph.

Note that I've called the new commit "13a".  This is to reflect the fact that,
while the *change* made is the same as in the original commit 13, the *SHA*
will not be the same anymore (new parent commit, new "tree", new committer
name/email, commit time, etc).

.#d

    .gv fig23.png
    "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 12
    .he 12 .. 13 .. 14
    .he 9 .. 10 .. 11 .. "13a"
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    [o] "sitas-repo/master"
    9 -- "origin/master"
    14 -- "sitas-repo/master"
    "13a" -- master .. HEAD

    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    11 -- m_old .. h_old
    13 .. "13a" [dir=none fontcolor="gray"]
    .end

![after cherry-pick](fig23.png)

.#t

## Rebasing

Instead of merging, let's say you wanted to rebase your commits on top of
Sita's commits.

First of all, what is rebasing?  It's basically transplanting a series of
changes from one point in the graph to another point.

So if you guessed that a rebase was (in principle) a series of cherry-picks,
you'd be pretty close, at least from a concept point.

.#d

So let's use a similar example as in the merge example before, but instead of
sitas-repo, the new commits are in "origin" (which is the "main" server for
this project).  You had your own commits, and you did a `git fetch origin`
which brought in the latest commits from "origin", so it looks like:

.#d

    .gv fig24.png
    .he "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    9 .. 12
    .he 12 .. 13
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    13 -- "origin/master"
    11 -- master .. HEAD
    .end

![after fetch](fig24.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

Now, instead of merging "origin/master" into your local master, you want to
rebase your commits on top of "origin/master".  That is, you want to pretend
your local changes were made *after* commit 13 on the origin.  So you run `git
rebase origin/master`, and this is the result:

.#d

    .gv fig25.png
    "[ . . . ]" .. 9 .. 10 .. 11
    .he 9 .. 12 .. 13 .. "10a" .. "11a"
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [o] "origin/master"
    13 -- "origin/master"
    "11a" -- master .. HEAD
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    11 -- m_old .. h_old
    10 .. "10a" [dir=none fontcolor="gray"]
    11 .. "11a" [dir=none fontcolor="gray"]
    .end

![after rebase](fig25.png)

.#t

Note that again, we're ignoring command syntax and nuances here.  This is
about concepts.  Also again, note that the SHAs of the 2 commits have changed,
since they now have new parents, trees, etc., so we represent that by
suffixing an "a".

Note the *dangling commits* 10 and 11.  No branch is now pointing to them, so
they're basically wasted disk space.  (They can be examined and reclaimed
using the 'reflog', or if left alone they will eventually get garbage
collected).

## {-}

.#d

Unlike cherry-pick, a rebase is quite often done in real life.  Rebase also
has some other forms.  This form is one, but the most common is when a
developer wants to re-arrange his own local commits in a more logical sequence
before publishing/pushing them.  I often do the eqvt of changing

.#d

    .gv fig26.png
    22 .. 23 .. "22delta" .. 24
    .end

![fixup commit](fig26.png)

.#r,d

where "22delta" is a minor fixup to "22", into

.#d

    .gv fig27.png
    "22a" .. "23a" .. "24a"
    .end

![fixup rebased](fig27.png)

.#r,d

using "git rebase -i".

Notice that since commit 22 changes its SHA, all its child commits -- now
rebased -- will also have new SHAs.  This is why you should (almost) never
rebase branches that have already been published.

# Tying Up Some Loose Ends

## The confusion about checkout and reset

**Please note** <font color="gray">that this section completely ignores the
myriad options available to both these commands, especially the ones that
pertain to the index and the working tree.  All we're trying to do is show
what the commands do to the branch and `HEAD`, nothing else.  As such, this is
not a complete discussion of those two commands, but only about one aspect of
them.

In fact, the major reason these two sometimes get confused is that people
eventually learn that `git checkout -f` and `git reset --hard` do the same
thing, and then extrapolate that to other options.  Just remember that both
those are specific cases of two quite different commands that just happen to
"meet" there, in some sense.</font>

The basic difference is very simple:

  * Checkout changes what your current branch (i.e., it changes where HEAD) is
    pointing to.
  * Reset changes which commit the current branch is pointing to.

## {-}

Here're some pictures that show you what's happening.  (Note that commits
below 6 and 7 are omitted for brevity).

The first picture is the common starting point.

    .gv fig28.png
    "starting point for both
    checkout and reset operations"
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    6 -- devel
    7 -- master
    master -- HEAD
    .end

![starting point](fig28.png)

The next two show the effect of a checkout and a reset, respectively.  Notice
which line is moving in each picture, compared to the starting point.

.#d

    .gv fig29.png
    "git checkout devel"
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    6 -- devel
    7 -- master
    .ie master .. HEAD
    .le devel -- HEAD
    .end

![checkout](fig29.png)

.#d

\ \ \ \ 

.#d

    .gv fig30.png
    "git reset devel"
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    [g] devel
    6 -- devel
    .ie 7 .. master
    .le 6 -- master
    master -- HEAD
    .end

![reset](fig30.png)

.#t

As you can see, your current branch, when you start, is "master" (indicated by
where HEAD is pointing).

A "checkout" changes what is your current branch -- it is now "devel", and so
any new commits you make now will go on devel, not master.

On the other hand, a reset changes what commit your current branch points to.
Your branch is still master, but now it is pointing to what could potentially
be a *completely* different history.

(Notice that, like in the rebase example, there is now a dangling commit --
one that cannot be reached by any branch.  It is still accessible using the
'reflog' and will eventually get garbage collected)

## Detached HEAD and all that

All this time you have seen HEAD pointing to a branch name, and the branch
itself pointing to a commit.  Then, when you make a commit, the branch moves
to the new commit (although HEAD still continue to point to the branch name).
If you want to recap, here's a look at just the part of the tree that concerns
us, in a simple before/after display:

.#d

    .gv fig31.png
    .he "[ . . . ] " .. 3 .. 7
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    7 -- master .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    [o] "origin/master"
    3 -- "origin/master"
    .end

![before commit](fig31.png)

.#d

    .gv fig32.png
    .he "[ . . . ] " .. 3 .. 7 .. 8
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    8 -- master .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    [o] "origin/master"
    3 -- "origin/master"
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    m_old [ label = "master" ]
    h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    7 -- m_old .. h_old
    .end

![after commit](fig32.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

Now see what happens when you `git checkout v1.0`:

Notice the subtle difference?  HEAD is no longer a **symbolic** ref (i.e.,
pointing to a real branch).  Instead, it is pointing directly to a commit.

.#d

    .gv fig33.png
    .he "[ . . . ] " .. 3 .. 7
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    7 -- master
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    3 -- HEAD
    [o] "origin/master"
    3 -- "origin/master"
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    [] h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    master -- h_old
    .end

![after checkout v1.0](fig33.png)

.#t

## {-}

In real terms, this is literally what happens.  When you had "master" checked
out, the contents of HEAD (it's just a file in .git) are simply

    ref: refs/heads/master

If you `git checkout devel` (which is a local branch), it becomes

    ref: refs/heads/devel

However, remember what we said earlier?  Only branches can move, tags cannot.
So when you `git checkout v1.0`, HEAD now contains

    90fed7792746a9a33e24059fb171f6bbb6ffebe6

or some such hash.  If it did what it did for local branches, it would imply
the tag would move, right?  Which it shouldn't -- wouldn't be much of a tag if
it moved!

.#d

So from this point on, if you make a commit, only HEAD changes, nothing else,
since it is no longer "attached" to any local branch name"

.#d

    .gv fig34.png
    .he "[ . . . ] " .. 3 .. 7
    3 .. 8
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    7 .. master
    8 .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    [o] "origin/master"
    3 -- "origin/master"
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    [] h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    3 -- h_old
    .end

![commit on detached HEAD](fig34.png)

.#t

## {-}

.#d

The reason this is considered dangerous is that, if you now do `git checkout
master`, you get this:

.#d

    .gv fig35.png
    .he "[ . . . ] " .. 3 .. 7
    3 .. 8
    [] [y] HEAD
    [g] master
    7 .. master .. HEAD
    [y] "v1.0"
    3 -- "v1.0"
    [o] "origin/master"
    3 -- "origin/master"
    edge [ color = "gray" ]
    node [ color = "gray" fontcolor = "gray" ]
    [] h_old [ label = "HEAD" ]
    8 -- h_old
    .end

![unreachable commit](fig35.png)

.#t

Notice what happened to your new commit 8?  It's dangling.  Unreachable.
(Except by the reflog, of course, but beginners can get shaken up!)

## Other ways to detach your HEAD

The most common way to get into a detached HEAD state is to check out a remote
branch (like `git checkout origin/branch`), without realising that you need to
make a local copy before you make commits on it.

<font color="gray">(Side note: the correct syntax to create and checkout a
local branch starting from a remote branch used to be `git checkout -t -b
branch origin/branch`, but modern gits will do the right thing if you simply
say `git checkout branch`; yaay for progress!)</font>

The reason `git checkout origin/branch` creates a detached HEAD is that, while
remote branches can move, they can only do so as a result of a `git fetch` or
equivalent.  After all, they are meant to track what the *remote* has, so it
wouldn't make sense for them to acquire *local* commits!

Here are various ways to detach HEAD:

    git checkout origin/master  # (described above)
    git checkout master^        # parent of master
    git checkout HEAD~2         # grandparent of current HEAD
    git checkout tagname        # since you cant commit to a tag!
    git checkout <SHA>          # hex digits forming a full or partial SHA
    git checkout master^0       # (see note below)

These will all make the file called `HEAD` contain the actual (40-hex-digit)
SHA of the corresponding commit instead of some string like `ref:
refs/heads/branch`.

That last one (`git checkout master^0`) is interesting.  The `master^0`
notation means "the actual commit that master points to", so it's just like
saying `git checkout <SHA>`.

## Reattaching the HEAD

Modern git will warn you about losing commits on a detached HEAD if you're at
the command line, and tell you how to recover (immediately).

Recovery is quite easy.  If you realised you're on a detached HEAD *before*
you switched to some other branch:

    git checkout -b newbranch

If you switched, possibly made some commits, and *then* realised you lost some
commits on a detached HEAD, you need to check the reflog to find the lost HEAD
and switch to that using some command like:

    git branch newbranch HEAD@{1}

## The reflog

The reflog can show you all the values that HEAD has taken in the past.
Here's a simulated example.  I cloned a repo that had a master and a 'foo'
branch.  Then I checked out `origin/foo`, ignored all the warnings, and made
two commits on what I thought was the "foo" branch.  Then I switched back to
master and made two normal commits on master before, I realised that I had
'lost' two commits.

At this point, running `git reflog show` gives me the following (the most
recent HEAD value is first):

    86a8ee0 HEAD@{0}: commit: my second commit on master
    e42c4d0 HEAD@{1}: commit: my first commit on master
    58c1539 HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from e2558a9d1527e5a76b39ffede1dc5ca9c650de01 to master
    e2558a9 HEAD@{3}: commit: second commit on foo
    1c9dfa0 HEAD@{4}: commit: first commit on foo
    802f184 HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from master to origin/foo
    58c1539 HEAD@{6}: clone: from /tmp/tmp.lv5IqjK0ZI/b

That `moving from <SHA>...` is usually a sign that some commits may have been
lost.  In this case you can run `git branch newbranch HEAD@{3}` or `git branch
newbranch e2558a9` to save those commits.  (Notice that the SHA value of
`HEAD@{3}` is the same one mentioned in the `moving from <SHA>...` message on
the line above it).

## The End

Hope that was useful...!
